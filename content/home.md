# NIH HCW Flu Study

## About

Six hospitals across Australia are conducting a research study in collaboration with the [World Health Organisation (WHO) Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza](http://influenzacentre.org)
and the [London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in the UK](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk). The study aims to
examine the immune response to influenza vaccination among hospital workers by measuring
antibody levels in blood before and after vaccination. The study will also examine the risk of
infection after vaccination by collecting nasal swabs and blood samples from health care
workers who develop flu-like illness.

The participating hospitals are:

- [Women’s and Children’s Hospital, Adelaide, SA](https://www.wch.sa.gov.au)
- [Queensland Children’s Hospital, Brisbane, QLD](https://www.childrens.health.qld.gov.au/qch)
- [Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, VIC](https://www.alfredhealth.org.au/)
- [John Hunter Hospital, New Lambton Heights, NSW](http://www.hnehealth.nsw.gov.au/john-hunter-hospital/Pages/Home.aspx)
- [Perth Children’s Hospital, Nedlands, WA](https://pch.health.wa.gov.au/)
- [Children’s Hospital at Westmead, NSW](https://www.schn.health.nsw.gov.au/hospitals/chw)

The research study is funded by the US National Institutes of Health grant number
`1R01AI141534-01A1`. The US National Institutes of Health has also funded a research
addendum to study SARS-CoV-2 in the health care worker cohort, grant number
`3R01AI141534-01A1S1 REVISED`

## What's involved?

- Participation will involve an initial visit before your vaccine, and follow up visits. The number of follow up visits depends on the arm of the study you enter. Most participants will have not more than 3 follow up visits, at approximately 7 days, 14 days and 7 months after vaccination. At each of these visits you will have a blood sample taken
- You will be asked to complete weekly symptom diaries (in form of an online survey)
- If you develop flu-like illness during the study, you will be asked to collect a nasal and/or
  throat swab for testing. If you test positive for flu or COVID-19, you will be asked to give
  additional samples during and after your illness
- Each time you are seen for a blood sample, you will be given a $10 voucher as compensation for your time
- The study will run for 4 years collecting samples from 2020 to 2023. The total time commitment for participating in this study is approximately 4 hours per year
- Participation is voluntary and you will be free to withdraw at any time.
