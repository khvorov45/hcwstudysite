# NIH HCW Flu Study

## About

Six hospitals across Australia are conducting a research study in collaboration with the World
Health Organisation (WHO) Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza
and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in the UK. The study aims to
examine the immune response to influenza vaccination among hospital workers by measuring
antibody levels in blood before and after vaccination. The study will also examine the risk of
infection after vaccination by collecting nasal swabs and blood samples from health care
workers who develop flu-like illness.

The participating hospitals are:

- The Women’s and Children’s Hospital, North Adelaide
- Queensland Children’s Hospital, South Brisbane
- The Alfred, Melbourne;
- John Hunter Hospital, New Lambton Heights;
- Perth Children’s Hospital, Nedlands (Perth);
- The Children’s Hospital at Westmead.

The research study is funded by the US National Institutes of Health grant number
`1R01AI141534-01A1`. The US National Institutes of Health has also funded a research
addendum to study SARS_CoV_2 in the health care worker cohort, grant number
`3R01AI141534-01A1S1 REVISED`.
