# NIH HCW Flu Study Overview

Six hospitals across Australia are conducting a research study in collaboration with the World Health Organisation (WHO) Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza. The study aims to examine the immune response to flu vaccination among hospital workers by measuring antibody levels in blood before and after vaccination. The study will also examine the risk of infection after vaccination by collecting nasal swabs and blood samples from health care workers who develop flu-like illness.

- All staff are invited to participate, especially those not intending to be vaccinated and those who will be getting the flu vaccine for the first time.
- Participation will involve an initial visit before your flu vaccine, with up to 3 follow up visits approximately 7 days, 14 days and 7 months after vaccination. At each of these visits you will have a blood sample taken.
- If you develop flu-like illness during the study, you will be asked to collect a nasal swab for influenza testing. If you test positive for flu, you will be asked to give blood samples approximately 7 and 14 days after your illness started.
- Each time you are seen for a blood sample, you will be given a $10 voucher as compensation for your time.
- The total time commitment for participating in this study is approximately 4 hours per year. The study will run for 4 years. Participation is voluntary and you will be free to withdraw at any time.
